# Typing Test

I wish I were really good at typing. And considering how much typing I've done, and will do, in my life, I really should put a little time into practicing good typing habits. This project was built with that in mind and so the goals were to design and build a smooth, straightforward typing experience with minimal distraction. I wanted for it to keep track of personal progress by storing the local results and I really like the idea of a global leaderboard to store and display the top scores.

Built using HTML, CSS, React, NodeJs and Mongo-Mongoose to store user results.
